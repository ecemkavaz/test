              A consent form is a signed document that outlines the informed consent of an individual for a medical study,
              clinical trial, or activity. Whether you’re looking for a way to gather model releases, activity waivers, parental consent,
              or medical consent forms, you can start by selecting one of our 400+ Consent Form Templates. Once you’ve chosen a consent form
              and customized its terms and conditions, all that’s left to do is embed the form on your website, send the link via email,
              or let participants fill out the form in person on your tablet or computer — you’ll then be able to securely collect consent forms online!
              You can even link your custom form to one of our Consent Agreement PDF Templates, to automatically turn form submissions into professional PDF documents.
              Not sure where to start? No worries! Just choose a sample consent form from the list below and easily customize it using JotForm’s
              drag-and-drop Form Builder — no coding or design experience necessary! Outline the responsibilities of all parties involved,
              add a detailed release of liability, and include any other information necessary to provide indemnity and protect both your company
              and the individual giving their informed consent. Why not spice up your form by adding your logo and changing the background color too?
              Your consent form won’t just function well — it’ll look good too.
              Make your consent form template even more efficient by adding JotForm’s powerful integrations.
              Connect with Google Sheets or Airtable to instantly generate a spreadsheet of all form submissions, or link your form to HubSpot, Zoho,
              or SalesForce to automatically add participants to your CRM database. Be sure to collect e-signatures to make your consent forms legally binding!
              By gathering consent forms online with JotForm, you’ll eliminate messy paperwork, streamline your workflow, and save time that could be better spent elsewhere.
